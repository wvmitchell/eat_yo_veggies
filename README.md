## Eat Yo Veggies

This minimal React app accompanies my talk on testing React applications with
Jest and Enzyme. Feel free to clone it down to follow along with my talk, extend
it to your heart's content.

To get it it up and running locally, first, install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), then:

```
npm i
npm start
```

To run the test suite:

```
npm run test
```
